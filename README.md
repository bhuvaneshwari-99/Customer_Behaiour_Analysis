# 📊 Data Analytics Project

## 🧭 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **data analytics workflow** — from data loading and cleaning to visualization and reporting.
It involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, executing **SQL queries**, creating a **Power BI dashboard**, and presenting insights through a **Gamma-generated presentation**.

The goal is to uncover key trends and insights from the dataset using Python and modern BI tools.

## 🧹 Steps & Process

### 1️⃣ Data Loading

* Loaded the dataset into Python using **Pandas**.
* Verified data structure, datatypes, and missing values.

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Handled missing and duplicate records.
* Standardized date, category, and numeric formats.
* Created new derived features (if applicable).

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visual exploration.
* Identified trends, outliers, and correlations between key metrics.
* Summarized findings into actionable insights.

### 4️⃣ SQL Analysis

* Imported cleaned data into **PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server**.
* Ran analytical queries for segmentation, aggregation, and performance metrics.
* Sample queries included:

  * Customer segmentation by purchase frequency.
  * Revenue trends by region or category.
  * Identifying top-performing products/customers.

### 5️⃣ Dashboard Creation (Power BI)

* Connected the cleaned dataset to Power BI.
* Designed interactive dashboards highlighting:

  * Key KPIs (Sales, Revenue, Growth Rate)
  * Regional performance
  * Product trends
  * Time-based analysis

### 6️⃣ Reporting & Presentation

* Created a summary **report** of the key findings and insights.
* Designed a **presentation using Gamma** to communicate results clearly and visually.
